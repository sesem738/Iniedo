# Inertial Odometry with Reinforcement Learning

The goal of the project is to perform end-to-end inertial navigation with deep reinforcement learning

## Project To-Do List

**Research**
- [ ] Research and implement non-linear Kalman Filters
- [ ] Read and understand TLIO and IMO research papers 

**Implementation**
- [ ] Implement and understand the concepts from the TLIO and IMO papers
- [ ] Create the Husky Dataset
- [ ] Recreate the TLIO Paper with the Husky Dataset

**Simulation**
- [ ] Create a simulated world environment
- [ ] Create and implement an end-to-end inertial navigation algorithm in the simulation

**Real-World Application**
- [ ] Adapt and apply the algorithm to real-world data

**Additional Methods**
- [ ] Research other relevant methods for inertial navigation
- [ ] Implement and test additional methods as needed
